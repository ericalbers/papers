Papers on the Point Universe Model and Spacetime Superfluid Hypothesis

## Overview
This repository contains four interconnected papers that propose a unified vision of reality:
- **Point Universe Model (PUM)**: All of reality emerges from the vibrations of a single point entity, mapped to spacetime via Fourier transforms.
- **Spacetime Superfluid Hypothesis (SSH)**: Spacetime is a quantum superfluid, with particles as excitations and gravity as density variations.
- **Black Holes as Superfluid Vortices**: Black holes are vortices in the SSH superfluid, offering non-singular cores and new perspectives on the information paradox.
- **Tired Light in SSH**: Cosmological redshift arises from photon energy loss in the superfluid, an alternative to universal expansion.

These ideas are speculative but mathematically consistent, blending quantum field theory, superfluid dynamics, and cosmology into a cohesive framework.

## Contents
- **Papers** (`papers/`):
  - `pointmodel.pdf`: The Point Universe Model, where reality vibrates from a single point.
  - `superfluidsolitoncleaned.pdf`: The Spacetime Superfluid Hypothesis, detailing spacetime as a superfluid.
  - `blackholesSSH.pdf`: Black Holes as Superfluid Vortices, reimagining black holes in SSH.
  - `tiredlight.pdf`: Tired Light in SSH, proposing redshift via photon energy loss in the superfluid.
- **Simulation** (`simulation/`):
  - `eraser4.py`: Python code simulating a quantum eraser in PUM, showing interference patterns in emergent spacetime.
  - `simulation_log.txt`: Log of the simulation, capturing a fringe shift from 13 to 14 post-erasure.
  - `internal_states.png`: Probability density in internal space (\(\xi_1, \xi_2\)).
  - `emergent_states.png`: Probability density in emergent spacetime (\(x, y\)), visualizing interference patterns.
-   

## Highlights
- **Quantum Eraser Simulation**: The simulation in PUM tests a quantum eraser, showing interference fringes jumping from 13 to 14 after which-path information is erased at \(t = 0.050\), as seen in `emergent_states.png`.
- **Tired Light Predictions**: The Tired Light paper predicts spectral distortions in quasars and time delays in gamma-ray bursts, offering testable alternatives to cosmic expansion.
- **Unified Framework**: The papers connect PUM’s single point vibrations to SSH’s superfluid, with black holes as vortices and redshift as energy loss—a cosmic symphony of ideas.
